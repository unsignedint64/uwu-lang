# UwU++ Design Documentation

UwU++ is a custom programming language that emphasizes playfulness and expressiveness in code. This document provides an overview of the design principles and decisions behind the language.

## Language Features

UwU++ introduces a set of custom defines that allow programmers to write code in a whimsical and creative manner. The following features are key to the design of UwU++:

- Custom defines for enhanced expressive coding
- Simple syntax that encourages experimentation
- Support for common programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and more

## Language Philosophy

The design philosophy of UwU++ is to create an environment where programmers can enjoy coding while maintaining readability and clarity. The use of playful syntax and macros is intended to make programming more engaging and enjoyable.

## Code Examples

Below are some examples that illustrate the design and features of UwU++:

- [Example 1: Printing with Emojis](./examples/character_conversion.cpp)
- [Example 2: Using Custom Defines](./examples/custom_defines.cpp)
- [Example 3: Whimsical Looping](./examples/looping.cpp)

## Future Directions

UwU++ is a project in its early stages, and there are many possibilities for future development. Some potential directions for the language include:

- Adding more built-in macros for different coding scenarios
- Exploring additional syntax elements to further enhance expressiveness

UwU++ is open to community contributions, and we look forward to growing and evolving the language together.
