# UwU++ Usage Instructions

UwU++ is designed to be a playful and expressive programming language. This document provides guidelines on how to use the custom defines and features of UwU++.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the UwU++ repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unsignedint64/uwu-lang.git
```

2. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

```bash
cd uwu-lang/src/
```

3. Compile and run your UwU++ code:

```bash
../scripts/build.sh main.cpp
```

## Key Features

UwU++ introduces a variety of custom defines that allow you to code in a unique and expressive style. Some of the key features include:

- `wog` and `endw` for printing with line breaks
- Mathematical operations like `max` and `min`
- Conditional constructs like `even` and `odd`

## Example Code

To understand the capabilities of UwU++, take a look at the example code snippets provided in the [examples](./examples) directory. These examples demonstrate how to use different macros and features to write fun and expressive code.

## Contributing

UwU++ is open to contributions from the community. If you have ideas for new defines, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) document.
