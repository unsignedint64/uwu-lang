# UwU++ Usage Instructions

UwU++ is designed to be a playful and expressive programming language. This document provides guidelines on how to use the custom defines and features of UwU++.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the UwU++ repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unsignedint64/uwu-lang.git
```

2. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

```bash
cd uwu-lang/src/
```

3. Compile and run your UwU++ code:

```bash

./uwu
```

## Key Features

UwU++ introduces a variety of custom defines that allow you to code in a unique and expressive style. Some of the key features include:

- `wog` and `endw` for printing with line breaks
- Mathematical operations like `uwu_max` and `uwu_min`
- Conditional constructs like `uwu_even` and `uwu_odd`

## Example Code

To understand the capabilities of UwU++, take a look at the example code snippets provided in the [examples](./examples) directory. These examples demonstrate how to use different macros and features to write fun and expressive code.
